1. Instructions to compile code:
   WHAM for 1D free energy profiles: make wham_colvar
   WHAM for 2D free energy profiles: make wham2d_colvar_vark

2. Instructions to run code:
   First, you must parse your input COLVAR files to remove comment lines
   and any duplicate lines (that occur when restarting a crashed simulation).
   Use US_parse_colvar.py to output files for desired time frames for 1D WHAM.
   Use US_parse_colvar2d.py for 2D WHAM.

   Run 1D WHAM: ./wham_colvar param.in
   Run 2D WHAM: ./wham2d_colvar_vark param.in

   Example parameter files (param1d.in and param2d.in) are included.
   Descriptions of these parameters are given below.

3. Input parameters:
   Example input parameter files are included as param1d.in and param2d.in
   Parameter      Value
   -------------------------------------------
   num_windows    <int> number of windows
   centers_fname  <string> name of files with window centers
                  1D wham: 1 col per row for each window
                  2D wham: each row lists centers of 1st CV and 2nd CV
                  followed by spring constant in bias on 1st CV in kJ/mol
                  and spring constant in bias on 2nd CV in kJ/mol
   colvar_dir     <string> directory with parsed colvar files
   colvar_fname   <string> general name of all colvar files to be used
                  includes one text formating specification for window number
   bin_width1     <float> width of bins in histogram along 1st axis
   bin_width2     <float> width of bins in histogram along 2nd axis (2D wham)
   start_value1   <float> minimum value of histogram along 1st axis
   start_value2   <float> minimum value of histogram along 2nd axis (2D wham)
   end_value1     <float> maximum value of histogram along 1st axis
   end_value2     <float> maximum value of histogram along 2nd axis (2D wham)
   kbias1         <float> value of spring constant for bias on 1st CV in kJ/mol
   kbt            <float> value of kT in kJ/mol used in simulation
